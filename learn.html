    <!-- BRUSHING -->
    <h3 id="brushing">🪥 Brushing Basics</h3>
    <p>
        Brushing removes plaque—the sticky film of bacteria that can lead to cavities and gum
        disease. Good brushing is about <strong>technique</strong> and <strong>consistency</strong>.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Brush <strong>two times a day</strong> (morning and night).</li>
        <li>Spend a full <strong>2 minutes</strong> each time.</li>
        <li>Use a <strong>soft-bristled toothbrush</strong> and fluoride toothpaste.</li>
        <li>Angle the brush 45° toward the gumline.</li>
        <li>Use small, gentle circles instead of rough scrubbing.</li>
        <li>Brush all surfaces: outer, inner, and chewing surfaces of every tooth.</li>
        <li>Brush your tongue to help with fresh breath.</li>
        <li>Replace your toothbrush every 3–4 months or after being sick.</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- FLOSSING -->
    <h3 id="flossing">🧵 Flossing Techniques</h3>
    <p>
        Flossing cleans between the teeth where your toothbrush can’t reach. It helps prevent
        cavities and gum inflammation between teeth.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Use about 18 inches of floss and wrap it around your middle fingers.</li>
        <li>Gently slide the floss between two teeth—never snap it down.</li>
        <li>Curve the floss into a “C” shape around the side of each tooth.</li>
        <li>Move the floss up and down, going slightly under the gumline.</li>
        <li>Use a clean section of floss as you move to the next tooth.</li>
        <li>If regular floss is hard to use, try floss picks or water flossers.</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- DENTAL VISIT -->
    <h3 id="visit">🦷 What a Typical Dental Visit Looks Like</h3>
    <p>
        Dental visits are an important part of prevention. They help catch small problems
        before they become big ones. A routine visit usually includes:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Medical & dental history review:</strong> Any changes in health, medications, or concerns.</li>
        <li><strong>X-rays (if needed):</strong> To check for cavities between teeth and below the surface.</li>
        <li><strong>Cleaning (prophylaxis):</strong> A dental hygienist removes plaque, tartar, and surface stains.</li>
        <li><strong>Gum evaluation:</strong> Measuring the health of your gums and checking for signs of gingivitis.</li>
        <li><strong>Exam by the dentist:</strong> Checking teeth, gums, bite, and soft tissues in your mouth.</li>
        <li><strong>Fluoride treatment (often for kids):</strong> Helps strengthen enamel and prevent decay.</li>
        <li><strong>Recommendations:</strong> The dentist may suggest changes to your routine or future treatment.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Most people should visit the dentist about <strong>every 6 months</strong>, or more often
        if their dentist recommends it.
    </p>

    <!-- COMMON PROCEDURES -->
    <h3 id="procedures">✨ Common Dental Procedures</h3>

    <h4>Regular Cleanings</h4>
    <p>
        A dental cleaning removes hardened tartar and plaque that brushing and flossing miss.
        This helps prevent gum disease, bad breath, and cavities.
    </p>

    <h4>Fillings</h4>
    <p>
        When bacteria break down tooth enamel and create a cavity, the dentist removes the
        decayed part and fills the space with a tooth-colored material. This restores the
        shape and function of the tooth and prevents the cavity from getting deeper.
    </p>

    <h4>Braces & Orthodontic Treatment</h4>
    <p>
        Braces or clear aligners gently move teeth into better positions over time. They can:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Correct crowding or spacing issues.</li>
        <li>Improve bite problems (overbite, underbite, crossbite).</li>
        <li>Make teeth easier to clean, which helps prevent cavities and gum disease.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Treatment often lasts 1–3 years, followed by a retainer to maintain the new alignment.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <!-- NUTRITION -->
    <h3 id="nutrition">🍎 Nutrition & Your Teeth</h3>
    <p>
        What you eat affects your mouth all day long. Bacteria in your mouth love sugar and
        use it to create acids that weaken enamel. Small changes in diet = big protection.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Limit sugary drinks like soda, sports drinks, and sweetened coffee/tea.</li>
        <li>Avoid sipping sugary drinks throughout the day—this constantly bathes teeth in acid.</li>
        <li>Choose tooth-friendly snacks: cheese, yogurt, nuts, crunchy fruits and vegetables.</li>
        <li>Drink water regularly, especially after meals or snacks.</li>
        <li>Try to keep sweets with meals instead of as frequent snacks.</li>
    </ul>
