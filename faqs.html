    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

    <h3>How often should I brush my teeth?</h3>
    <p>Brush twice a day for two full minutes — once in the morning and once before bed.</p>

    <h3>When should kids first see a dentist?</h3>
    <p>Kids should see a dentist by age 1, or within six months of their first tooth appearing.</p>

    <h3>Why do my gums bleed when I brush or floss?</h3>
    <p>
        Bleeding gums are often a sign of inflammation caused by plaque. The best response is to
        keep brushing gently along the gumline and floss daily. If bleeding continues for more than
        a week or is painful, contact a dentist.
    </p>

    <h3>Do baby teeth really matter if they fall out?</h3>
    <p>
        Yes! Baby teeth help children chew, speak clearly, and hold space for adult teeth. Keeping
        baby teeth healthy can prevent pain, infections, and future orthodontic problems.
    </p>

    <h3>How do I know if I or my child might need braces?</h3>
    <p>
        Signs can include crowded or overlapping teeth, big spaces, difficulty biting or chewing,
        or a jaw that looks “too far forward” or “too far back.” A dentist or orthodontist can
        evaluate the bite and make a recommendation.
    </p>

    <h3>Are sports drinks and soda really that bad for teeth?</h3>
    <p>
        Yes. Drinks with sugar and acid (like soda, sports drinks, and energy drinks) can weaken
        enamel over time. It’s best to keep them as rare treats and rinse with water afterward.
    </p>

    <h3>What is the best way to help kids brush better?</h3>
    <p>
        Turn brushing into a routine and make it fun — use a timer or song, brush together, and
        let kids choose their toothbrush and toothpaste flavor (fluoride toothpaste for age-appropriate
        groups). Parents should help or supervise until about age 7–8.
