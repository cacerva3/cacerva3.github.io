    <h2>About Healthy Smiles</h2>

    <p>
        <strong>Healthy Smiles</strong> was created as an educational space to make oral health
        easy to understand, less scary, and actually interesting. As a pre–dental student, my goal
        is to share what I am learning and turn it into clear, simple information that children,
        teens, and families can use in real life.
    </p>

    <h3>What Is Healthy Smiles?</h3>
    <p>
        This website is designed to be a <strong>starter guide to oral health</strong>. It brings
        together trusted information, visuals, and interactive resources to help answer questions like:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>What really causes cavities?</li>
        <li>How do I brush and floss the right way?</li>
        <li>Why do my gums bleed sometimes?</li>
        <li>How do food and drinks affect my teeth?</li>
        <li>When should I visit the dentist, and what happens there?</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Who Is This Website For?</h3>
    <p>
        Healthy Smiles is for anyone who wants to understand their mouth better, especially:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Kids and teens</strong> who are building daily brushing and flossing habits.</li>
        <li><strong>Parents and caregivers</strong> who want resources to support their children’s oral health.</li>
        <li><strong>Students</strong> who are curious about dentistry and preventive care.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Why Oral Health Matters</h3>
    <p>
        Oral health is about more than just a “nice smile.” A healthy mouth can:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Help you eat, speak, and smile confidently.</li>
        <li>Prevent pain, infections, and expensive dental treatments later on.</li>
        <li>Support your overall health, since the mouth is connected to the rest of the body.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Explore the <strong>Learn/Prevent</strong> section for tips and explanations, and visit the
        <strong>Fun Zone</strong> for activities that make practicing healthy habits a little more fun.  
        The goal is simple: <strong>knowledge today, healthier smiles tomorrow.</strong>
